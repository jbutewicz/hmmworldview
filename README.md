## hmmworldview

I'm a bot that combines multiple popular images to give a snapshot of the worldview as portrayed by the media.

Includes twitterbot and code to run the site.

### Prerequisites

Built with Python 3. Install everything in requirements.txt. You probably want virtualenv. You will need a twitter account to make posts to your account. Add credentials to instance/config.py.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
